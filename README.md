# Log2Sentry

Lambda for logging an Exception to Sentry

If Sentry doesn't provide an SDK for your programming language, you can capture the exception and send it to this lambda, which is able to forward it to Sentry.

TODO:

- Improve this README
- Create a config script, to config the deployment according to an AWS profile and bucket name
- Create documentation on OpenAPI / Swagger format
- Write tests
